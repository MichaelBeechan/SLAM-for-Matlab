%J2COMP Second Jacobian of the compound operator.%   J = J2COMP(XI,XJ) returns the Jacobian matrix of the 2D composition%   of XI and XJ derived with respect to the second operand. All X's are%   3x1-vectors, J is a 3x3 matrix.%%   See also J1COMP, JINV, COMPOUND, ICOMPOUND.% v.1.0, 30.11.02, Kai Arras, ASL-EPFLfunction J2 = j2comp(xij,xjk);J2 = [cos(xij(3)), -sin(xij(3)), 0;      sin(xij(3)),  cos(xij(3)), 0;          0,             0,      1];
